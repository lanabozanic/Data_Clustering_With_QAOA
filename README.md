# Data Clustering With QAOA

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms that focuses on solving combinatiorial optimization problems, and hopes to provide speed up over it's classical counterparts in the near term. 

In this repo, we decided to focus on using QAOA solving the Maximum Cut problem, which subsequentially clustered data into two seperate groups. Our implementation was derived from this paper, originally written by Leo Zhou and Sheng-Tao Wang et al. : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01041.pdf
