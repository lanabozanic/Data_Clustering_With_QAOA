        "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm doesn't actually solve for the exact max value, but instead approximates it (hence the creative name). Although there are many classical algorithms that can do this already, QAOA has the potential to show speed ups over the classical algorithms as the circuit depth, p -> âˆž . At this point in time, the best performance we've achieved with the QAOA algorithm is at depth p = 1, so there is still much more exploring to do. The goal of QAOA is to optimize for some value, z, that maximizes the cost function, $C = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{m} C_m(z)$, where $ z = z_1z_1...z_k$. But since we're not actually aiming for the exact value, just a really good approximation, our goal is to find a  $ \\dfrac{C(z)}{C_{max}} $ such that their ratio gets closer and closer to 1   (i.e. $ C(z) $ gets closer and closer to $ C_{max} $)\n",
